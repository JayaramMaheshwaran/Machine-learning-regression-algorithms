Linear Regression: A linear approach to modeling the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. The model predicts the dependent variable as a linear combination of the independent variables.

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Regression: A non-parametric method where the prediction for a new data point is made based on the average of the nearest K training data points.

Decision Tree Regression: A decision support tool that uses a tree-like model of decisions and their possible consequences. The model splits the data into subsets based on the values of the input features.

Random Forest Regression: An ensemble learning method that constructs multiple decision trees and merges them together to get a more accurate and stable prediction.

XGBoost Regression: An optimized distributed gradient boosting library designed to be highly efficient, flexible, and portable. It uses a gradient boosting framework to predict the target variable.

Support Vector Machine (SVM) Regression: A method that uses a hyperplane in a multidimensional space to separate different classes. In regression, it tries to fit the best line within a threshold value, minimizing the error.

The provided code will help you load a dataset, train these regression models, evaluate their performance, and compare their R^2 scores using a bar chart.
